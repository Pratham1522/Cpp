Stop Crying, Stop Escaping, Stop Running away, 
Doing that wont get you anywhere.

Do you know how to forge a sword, 
The thing with sword is, 
You Strike and Strike and Strike them, 
and get rid of all the impurities.

Your parents never give up on you,
Belive in yourself , Dont ever give up,
Do the hellish training.

To be the Best among all,
You need to be the the most Hardworking in the room.

All Dreams will be chased,
But those, who will give their all.
