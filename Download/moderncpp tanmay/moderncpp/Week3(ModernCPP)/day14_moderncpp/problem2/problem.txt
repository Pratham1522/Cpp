create a function that takes one number as input
create a func that:
a) allocate memory on the heap for 1 integer
b) computes square of input received and saves it in the allocated space
c) prints the output in the console as well

design a system where both the functions run in separate threads and use producer 
consumer mechanism for coordination
    -->input
    -->malloc() + computesquare()-->Print()


solution a: only 1 thread, single threaded program. no nonsense
solution b: only 1 thread, mem functions, OOP!
solution c: multiple threads with sync, finish input, then start 2nd function (WORST!!)

solution d: multiple threads with sync,
first thread is on input, 2nd threads performs malloc,
then waits for input to be received. upon signal, computes square and displays result

SOLUTION A:
    start---> INput() _____>F@()----[malloc,computesquare,display]--->end!!

SOLUTION D:
    start----->input()------------------>[number is received from user]
        ---->F@-------->[malloc][wait mode for INPUT] -----------> {calculate, square, display}---end!!
