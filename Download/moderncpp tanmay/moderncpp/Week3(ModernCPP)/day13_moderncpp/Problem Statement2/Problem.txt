Create a function that takes one number as input.

Create a function that.

a) Allocates memory on the heap for one integer.
b) Computes square of input received and saves it in the allocated space.
c) prints the output on the console as well.

Design a system where the both functions run in separate threads ans use producer consumer mechanism for cordination.

/*
   ->Input
   ->Malloc() + compute square() + Display ();

   Approach 1-
   Only 1 thread, Single threaded program. No nonsense.
   Approach 2-
   Only 1 thread, member function, OOP!
   Approach 3-
   Multiple threads with synchronization, finish input, then start second func[worst].
   Approach 4-
   Multiple threads with synchronization, first thread focusses on input,second thread performs malloc,then wait for the input to be recived,upon signal, computes square and display result.



   Approach 1-

   start------>Input()----------->F2()----------->[malloc,compute square,display]------->end();


   Approach 2-

   start------->Input()--------------->[number is received from user].

        ------->f2 --------->[malloc][wait for the input]  -------->[calculate sq,display] ----->end();
