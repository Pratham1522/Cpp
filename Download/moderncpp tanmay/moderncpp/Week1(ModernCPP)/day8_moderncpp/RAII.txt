RESOURCE ACQUISITION IS INITIALIZATION (principle)
acquiring resource (heap memory for customer) is same as initializing an owner

Whatever my program accesses to complete its opeartiosn are basically called "Resources".
    -heap memory
    -files
    -connection pointers
    -semaphores/mutexes (synchronization primitives)


template<typename T>
class Wrapper(){
    private:
        T* m_ptr;

    Wrapper(T* p) : m_ptr{p}
    public:
        ~Wrapper(){delete m_ptr;}
};


void Magic(){
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(20);
    Wrapper c(new Customer());
}

//THIS IS CALLED CONNECTING RESOURCE TO LIFETIME OF OBJECTS AND CALLED IT AS SMART POINTERS.
