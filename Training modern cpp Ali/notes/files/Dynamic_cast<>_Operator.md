## Dynamic_cast<X*> Operator 
```cpp
IX* px = new CX(); 
IY* py = dynamic_cast<IY*>(px);
```
- The 'dynamic_cast' operator in C++ is used for performing safe downcasting of pointers or references in a class hierarchy. When you have a base class pointer to a derived class object, you can use 'dynamic_cast' to cast it to a pointer of another class type within the inheritance hierarchy.
- 'dynamic_cast' performs runtime type checking to ensure that the conversion is safe, and it returns a pointer of the target type if the conversion is possible, otherwise it returns 'nullptr'.
